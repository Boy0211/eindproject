# FinanciÃ«le welzijn studenten in Nederland


### Did the change of the studentgrant into a studentloan any direct effect on the number of students living with their parents?
*This project is meant for the students. Almost 4 years ago the government
decided to change the studentgrant into a studentloan. The money saved with this
change would be invested in education. Some years later we can finally check if
the government made up to their promise and if the change had any effects on the
students. But not olny the grant is gone. In the last decades the pressure on
students heavily changed. Are the financial uncertainties an extra factor that
causes burn outs among students?*


### How will it look:

The mimimum viable project will contain the following:
* A interactive bar chart with the expenses of the government spending on education
* A interactive map of the Netherlands with a information about how many students
live at home vs living away from their parents
* Line graph per city with the prices of a student house
* A home page with information on the project

Optional:
* visuzalization about the expenses of a student
* Extra information about countrys around the Netherlands

*External components:*
Linbaries: D3, statline

*Similar:*
I have not found any similar visualization other than the Student Projects given from the last year

*Hardest Parts:*
The hardest part will be ordening the data. Even though there is a lot of data
about Students in the Netherlands, I am afraid that certain data I want to use
will be protected from the public. After that ordening the data will be a lot of
work. In the end I need to find particular data from somtimes huge datasets.
